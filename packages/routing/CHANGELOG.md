# @adaptivemcp/routing

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 90e5e71: Phase 10 advanced graph intelligence:

  - `@adaptivemcp/graph-analysis`: `getCausalCascade` (ancestor-based root-cause vs. symptom ordering), `getWorkflowForecast` (historical-baseline duration/cost/failure-probability projection for an in-progress session), and `detectAntiPatterns` (`sequential_bottleneck` and `diamond_dependency` detectors). Also fixes a bug in `detectCommonPatterns` that always attributed duration/success data to the first session in a workflow regardless of which pattern was being counted.
  - `@adaptivemcp/memory`: new `MemoryStore.getWorkflowIds()`, and `Store.getWorkflowIds?()` on the shared interface.
  - `@adaptivemcp/evaluation`: `Evaluator.evaluateAllWorkflows()` was a stub that always returned `[]` — it now enumerates workflows and their sessions, evaluates each, and persists a cross-session `workflow_common_pattern` insight via `GraphAnalyzer.getWorkflowStats`.
  - `@adaptivemcp/routing`: new `Router.routeByPosition(sessionId, analyzer)`, a pure (non-persisting) method that recommends the lowest-latency model for critical-path nodes and the cheapest for leaves in a specific session. Adds `@adaptivemcp/graph-analysis` as a dependency.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 00b51e6: Fix the MCP resource URI and make the adaptation loop honest.

  - **spec**: add `TOOLS_METADATA_RESOURCE_URI` (`dev.adaptivemcp://tools-metadata`), a valid URL form of the logical `TOOLS_METADATA_EXTENSION` identifier, for resource registration and reads.
  - **extension**: `ExtensionController.resourceUri()` now returns the valid URI so clients can actually `readResource` it (previously the scheme-less identifier threw `Invalid URL`).
  - **routing**: `Router` recommendation rationale now reflects the real heuristic — "Cheapest model for fast tool" vs "Lowest-latency model for slow tool… trades cost for speed" — instead of always claiming "cheapest".
  - **runtime**: `AdaptiveRuntime.observeCompleted` now runs only the minimal `telemetry → evaluate → sync` loop. Routing, orchestration, and approval are explicit passes (`router.routeAll()` / `orchestrator.planAll()`) the caller invokes once enough signal has accumulated. This is a behavioral change to the public method, so it is a minor bump.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 67875dd: docs: mark routing/orchestration/approval/thin-client as published

  These four packages are already on npm; their READMEs still carried the
  stale "private / not yet published" status line. Updated the status and added
  usage examples. No API change.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 72b57ab: Decouple packages from the concrete SQLite store and ship a batteries-included runtime.

  - Add a `Store` interface to `@adaptivemcp/spec`; `MemoryStore` now implements it.
    All middleware packages depend on the interface, so the persistence backend is
    swappable without touching the learning loop.
  - Extract `AdaptiveRuntime` out of `examples` into a new `@adaptivemcp/runtime`
    package (transport-agnostic; accepts any `Store`).
  - Promote `routing`, `orchestration`, `approval`, and `thin-client` from private
    stubs to published `0.1.0` packages.
  - Unify Node version guidance to "Node 22+ (Node 26 recommended)".
  - Add a release dry-run CI gate (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
