## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- fcb25d7: Add per-package README files and include them in the published npm tarballs
  (previously the `files` allowlist shipped only `dist`, so package pages on npm
  showed "This package does not have a README"). Each published package now ships
  usage examples, API tables, and its relationship to the MCP extension surface.

  - @adaptivemcp/spec@0.1.1
  - @adaptivemcp/memory@0.2.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f750daf: Initial adaptive implementation: spec foundation (extension identifiers, event
  schemas, shared types), SQLite-backed memory store (SSOT), telemetry
  (recorder + memory-backed store + queries), evaluation (insight generation from
  observed stats), and the extension controller that derives the
  `tools-metadata.yaml` view from the SQLite SSOT.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [f750daf]
  - @adaptivemcp/spec@0.1.0
  - @adaptivemcp/memory@0.2.0
