# @adaptivemcp/spec

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 9df0b31: Phase 11 MCP ecosystem integration:

  - `@adaptivemcp/spec`: new canonical `ExecutionGraphResource` wire schema and pure `buildExecutionGraph` builder (`execution-graph.ts`), replacing the dead, Map-based (non-JSON-serializable) `ExecutionGraph` type, which had zero consumers.
  - `@adaptivemcp/extension`: `executionGraphResourceUri`/`workflowGraphResourceUri`/`graphInsightsResourceUri`/`executionGraphMermaidResourceUri` now return correctly-formed `dev.adaptivemcp://...` URIs (previously missing the `//`, a latent bug harmless until these were wired into real MCP protocol dispatch). `executionGraphResourceText` gains `cursor`/`pageSize` pagination options; edges are always returned in full regardless of the current node page.
  - `@adaptivemcp/thin-client`: `GraphTrackingMiddleware` now generates a valid W3C `traceparent` per node (deterministically derived from existing `ExecutionNode` UUIDs — `traceId`/`spanId`/`parentSpanId`/`traceparent` on `metadata`), exposed via a new `getTraceParent()` method. This is a data-plane correlation primitive, not literal over-the-wire header propagation — no live MCP transport exists in this codebase to carry HTTP headers on.
  - `@adaptivemcp/runtime`: `AdaptiveRuntimeOptions.enableGraph` plus `startWorkflow`/`startChild`/`completeNode`/`failNode` pass-throughs, bringing this package to parity with the example-local runtime's existing graph-tracking wiring.
  - `examples/`: the execution-graph resource is now a real, working `ResourceTemplate` with pagination and `resources/subscribe`/`notifications/resources/updated`, verified end-to-end with a live stdio client/server run.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 00b51e6: Fix the MCP resource URI and make the adaptation loop honest.

  - **spec**: add `TOOLS_METADATA_RESOURCE_URI` (`dev.adaptivemcp://tools-metadata`), a valid URL form of the logical `TOOLS_METADATA_EXTENSION` identifier, for resource registration and reads.
  - **extension**: `ExtensionController.resourceUri()` now returns the valid URI so clients can actually `readResource` it (previously the scheme-less identifier threw `Invalid URL`).
  - **routing**: `Router` recommendation rationale now reflects the real heuristic — "Cheapest model for fast tool" vs "Lowest-latency model for slow tool… trades cost for speed" — instead of always claiming "cheapest".
  - **runtime**: `AdaptiveRuntime.observeCompleted` now runs only the minimal `telemetry → evaluate → sync` loop. Routing, orchestration, and approval are explicit passes (`router.routeAll()` / `orchestrator.planAll()`) the caller invokes once enough signal has accumulated. This is a behavioral change to the public method, so it is a minor bump.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 72b57ab: Decouple packages from the concrete SQLite store and ship a batteries-included runtime.

  - Add a `Store` interface to `@adaptivemcp/spec`; `MemoryStore` now implements it.
    All middleware packages depend on the interface, so the persistence backend is
    swappable without touching the learning loop.
  - Extract `AdaptiveRuntime` out of `examples` into a new `@adaptivemcp/runtime`
    package (transport-agnostic; accepts any `Store`).
  - Promote `routing`, `orchestration`, `approval`, and `thin-client` from private
    stubs to published `0.1.0` packages.
  - Unify Node version guidance to "Node 22+ (Node 26 recommended)".
  - Add a release dry-run CI gate (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 507cfad: update ssot to store

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 2b4898f: update license

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- fcb25d7: Add per-package README files and include them in the published npm tarballs
  (previously the `files` allowlist shipped only `dist`, so package pages on npm
  showed "This package does not have a README"). Each published package now ships
  usage examples, API tables, and its relationship to the MCP extension surface.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- f750daf: Initial adaptive implementation: spec foundation (extension identifiers, event
  schemas, shared types), SQLite-backed memory store (SSOT), telemetry
  (recorder + memory-backed store + queries), evaluation (insight generation from
  observed stats), and the extension controller that derives the
  `tools-metadata.yaml` view from the SQLite SSOT.
