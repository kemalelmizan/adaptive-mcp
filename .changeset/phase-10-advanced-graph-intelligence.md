Phase 10 advanced graph intelligence:

- `@adaptivemcp/graph-analysis`: `getCausalCascade` (ancestor-based root-cause vs. symptom ordering), `getWorkflowForecast` (historical-baseline duration/cost/failure-probability projection for an in-progress session), and `detectAntiPatterns` (`sequential_bottleneck` and `diamond_dependency` detectors). Also fixes a bug in `detectCommonPatterns` that always attributed duration/success data to the first session in a workflow regardless of which pattern was being counted.
- `@adaptivemcp/memory`: new `MemoryStore.getWorkflowIds()`, and `Store.getWorkflowIds?()` on the shared interface.
- `@adaptivemcp/evaluation`: `Evaluator.evaluateAllWorkflows()` was a stub that always returned `[]` — it now enumerates workflows and their sessions, evaluates each, and persists a cross-session `workflow_common_pattern` insight via `GraphAnalyzer.getWorkflowStats`.
- `@adaptivemcp/routing`: new `Router.routeByPosition(sessionId, analyzer)`, a pure (non-persisting) method that recommends the lowest-latency model for critical-path nodes and the cheapest for leaves in a specific session. Adds `@adaptivemcp/graph-analysis` as a dependency.
