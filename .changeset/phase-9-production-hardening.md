Phase 9 production hardening for the execution graph:

- `@adaptivemcp/memory`: WAL journal mode + tuned PRAGMAs for file-backed stores, a versioned migration framework for `execution_nodes`, and `pruneExecutionNodes`/`retention` for TTL-based cleanup.
- `@adaptivemcp/thin-client`: `GraphTrackingMiddleware` now uses `AsyncLocalStorage` instead of a shared array stack, fixing a concurrency bug where parallel tool calls (e.g. via `Promise.all`) could misattribute parent/child linkage, cost, and duration to the wrong node. `ThinClient.run()` now wraps each call's full lifecycle in `GraphTrackingMiddleware.runInContext` — a breaking change for direct callers of `GraphTrackingMiddleware.beforeCall`/`afterCall`/`onError` outside that wrapper.
- `@adaptivemcp/graph-analysis`: new `IncrementalGraphAnalyzer`, an opt-in `GraphAnalyzer` subclass that caches session/workflow node reads to avoid re-querying the store on every call for long-running or repeatedly-polled workflows.
- `@adaptivemcp/extension`: execution graph MCP resource documents now carry real content-hash ETags instead of an empty placeholder, and `executionGraphResourceText`/`workflowGraphResourceText`/`graphInsightsResourceText` accept an `ifNoneMatch` option, returning `{ notModified: true, etag }` instead of the full document when it matches — a minor breaking change to their return type (`string | NotModified` instead of `string`).
